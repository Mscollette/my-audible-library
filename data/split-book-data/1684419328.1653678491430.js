window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A mayor's inspirational story of a Midwest city that has become nothing less than a blueprint for the future of American renewal.</b></p> <p>Once described by <i>The Washington Post </i>as \"the most interesting mayor you've never heard of\", Pete Buttigieg, the 36-year-old Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has improbably emerged as one of the nation's most visionary politicians. First elected in 2011, Buttigieg left a successful business career to move back to his hometown, previously tagged by <i>Newsweek </i>as a \"dying city\", because the industrial Midwest beckoned as a challenge to the McKinsey-trained Harvard graduate. Whether meeting with city residents on middle-school basketball courts, reclaiming abandoned houses, confronting gun violence, or attracting high-tech industry, Buttigieg has transformed South Bend into a shining model of urban reinvention.</p> <p>While Washington reels with scandal, <i>Shortest Way Home</i> interweaves two once unthinkable success stories: that of an Afghanistan veteran who came out and found love and acceptance, all while in office, and that of a Rust Belt city so thoroughly transformed that it shatters the way we view America's so-called flyover country.</p>";
