They have to record the 1601 performance of <i>Hamlet</i>, with Shakespeare himself in the role of the Ghost. It doesn't go well, of course. </p> <p>With Dr Bairstow and Mrs Mack turning a simple visit to a street market into a public brawl, Professor Rapson inadvertently stowing away on a vessel bound for the New World, and Shakespeare himself going up in flames, it would seem that Max, of all people, is the only one actually completing the assignment. </p>";
