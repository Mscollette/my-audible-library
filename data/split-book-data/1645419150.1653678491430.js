But Calexa can’t hide from the dead - and because she can see spirits, they can’t hide from her.</p> <p>Then one night, Calexa spies a group of teenagers vandalizing a grave - and watches in horror as they commit murder. As the victim’s spirit rises from her body, it flows into Calexa, overwhelming her mind with visions and memories not her own.</p> <p>Now Calexa must make a decision: continue to hide to protect herself - or come forward to bring justice to the sad spirit who has reached out to her for help....</p> <p>Performed by Emlyn McFarland, Nora Achrati, Dawn Ursula, Andy Brownstein, Shari Elliker, Richard Rohan, Nick DePinto, KenYatta Rogers, Kellee Knighten Hough, Jacob Yeh, David Harris, Tony Nam, Doug Brown, Drew Kopas, Elizabeth Jernigan, John Dow, Evan Casey.</p>";
