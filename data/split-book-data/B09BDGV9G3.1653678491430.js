Whispers spread that a hellhound prowls the streets, snatching the lost souls who have escaped the afterworld. Except, Wycliff is doing no such thing - could there possibly be another such creature in London?</p> <p>While Hannah and Wycliff investigate the unnatural flames, unrest grows on the streets as someone seeks to unmask how the undead women stave off rot. Someone is agitating for all Afflicted to be eradicated, in a conspiracy that will set the common Englishman against the nobles.</p> <p>To save the Afflicted and stop the uprising, Wycliff must face the void that whispers his name from an inky darkness. While he's there, he plans to wrest Hannah free of the curse squeezing her heart, assuming they can get out alive....</p>";
