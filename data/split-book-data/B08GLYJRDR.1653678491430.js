window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A quiet Irish village? Not so much!</b></p> <p>An ancient curse seems to be causing bad luck in the charming village of Ballydehag, Ireland - witch Quinn Callahanâ€™s new home. When someone is murdered, is it the curse? Or, is there a very human murderer on the loose?</p> <p>Moving to a small Irish village was supposed to keep the middle-aged witch out of trouble. Yeah, that didn't happen. Quinn and her bookish vampires must find the real killer and end the curse before someone else dies.</p> <p>If you like quirky characters, mystery, humor and a touch of romance, don't miss this second installment in the Vampire Book Club series from the best-selling author of The Vampire Knitting Club. Each book is a complete story that can be listened to on its own.</p>";
