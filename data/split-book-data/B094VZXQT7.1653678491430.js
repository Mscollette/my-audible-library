window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A paranormal cozy mystery series from </b><b><i>USA Today </i></b><b>best-selling author Nancy Warren</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Under the Great British Baking Contest competition tent, there's more at stake than winning the title of Best Baker in All of Britain. For amateur baker Poppy Wilkinson, there are mysteries to solve, secrets and lies, even murder. As a fledgling witch, Poppy's having enough trouble controlling her sponge cake, never mind trying to control her powers. Besides solving crime, Poppy's also trying to uncover the mystery surrounding her own background. Will she discover who she really is before she gets sent home? Or worse?&nbsp;</p> <p>The Great Witches Baking Show is a loving homage to all competitive baking shows, but especially Bake-Off. Imagine Bake-Off with witches and murders - and recipes! Set in the lovely English countryside, these are classic British mysteries with a twist. There's no gore, swearing, or sex in these paranormal cozy mysteries - just good fun, quirky characters, an interfering ghost, and an adorable familiar or three. Sink your teeth into this bingeable series today.&nbsp;</p>";
