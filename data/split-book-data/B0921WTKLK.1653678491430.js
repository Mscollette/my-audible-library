The road has massive potholes.</b></p> <p>And the crisis...it’s the gift that keeps on giving.</p> <p>Being 40 is supposed to be freaking fabulous, not fatal.</p> <p>Taking on a daunting new job minus the description isn’t the smartest move I’ve ever made, even if it was to save a friend. Hopefully, it doesn’t turn out to be the stupidest...or deadliest.</p> <p>Why can’t things stay the way they were? I love my old job. Supergluing ghosts back together and solving their issues is its own reward. Not to mention, I’m seriously good at it. Although, I must say, I’m ridiculously excited for the new Death Counselor’s arrival in nine months....</p> <p>Adding to my problems, there are four new angels in town who are riding my butt and judging every move I make. Literally. Who knew destroying one Immortal could cause me so much trouble? If I’m found guilty, I’ll be pushing up daisies.</p> <p>Luckily, my nutty friends have my back and the Grim Reaper has my heart. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Nothing is impossible. I am living proof. Let’s just hope I live to prove it.</p>";
