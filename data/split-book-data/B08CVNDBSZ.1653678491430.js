window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From Book 1:</p> <p>I was a divorced, middle-aged witch banished to Ireland.&nbsp;</p> <p>My life could be summed up in a limerick....</p> <p>There once was a misguided witch&nbsp;</p> <p>Who tried a man’s fate to switch&nbsp;</p> <p>Her punishment set&nbsp;</p> <p>To Ireland she must get&nbsp;</p> <p>But better than feathers and pitch!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With a name like Quinn Calahan, I sounded as Irish as a leprechaun dancing a jig on a four leafed clover, but the truth was, I’d never been closer to the emerald isle than drinking green beer at the St Patrick’s day street party in Boston until I messed up so badly I had to leave the US. I was offered a job in a tiny village in Ireland that no one’s ever heard of. And I think that was the point in sending me there. How much trouble could a divorced, middle-aged witch get into in a village that boasted very few residents, one crumbling castle that attracted no tourists, and a post office that was only open Mondays and Thursdays?&nbsp;</p> <p>You’d be surprised.&nbsp;</p> <p>You will fall in love with this series about second chances, magical mayhem, and book club unlike any other. From the author of the best-selling Vampire Knitting Club series.</p>";
