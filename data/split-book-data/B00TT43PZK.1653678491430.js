And hanging on to it is even harder.... </p><p>Jodi Taylor brings all her comic writing skills to this heartwarming tale of self-discovery. </p><p>Known as <i>The Nothing Girl</i> because of her severe stutter and chronically low self-confidence, Jenny Dove is only just prevented from ending it all by the sudden appearance of Thomas, a mystical golden horse only she can see. Under his guidance Jenny unexpectedly acquires a husband - the charming and chaotic Russell Checkland - and for her nothing will ever be the same again.With overprotective relatives on one hand and the world's most erratic spouse on the other, Jenny needs to become someone. And fast! </p><p>Fans of Jodi Taylor's best-selling <i>Chronicles of St. Mary's</i> series will adore the quirky humour in this new, contemporary novel.
