window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>In this intimate, haunting literary memoir and </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> Notable Book of the year, an American icon tells her own story for the first time - about a challenging and lonely childhood, the craft that helped her find her voice, and a powerful emotional legacy that shaped her journey as a daughter and a mother.</b></p> <p>One of the most celebrated, beloved, and enduring actors of our time, Sally Field has an infectious charm that has captivated the nation for more than five decades, beginning with her first TV role at the age of 17. From <i>Gidget</i>'s sweet-faced \"girl next door\" to the dazzling complexity of <i>Sybil </i>to the Academy Award-worthy ferocity and depth of <i>Norma Rae</i> and Mary Todd Lincoln, Field has stunned audiences time and time again with her artistic range and emotional acuity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet there is one character who always remained hidden: the shy and anxious little girl within. With raw honesty and the fresh, pitch-perfect prose of a natural-born writer, and with all the humility and authenticity her fans have come to expect, Field brings listeners behind-the-scenes for not only the highs and lows of her star-studded early career in Hollywood, but deep into the truth of her lifelong relationships - including her complicated love for her own mother.&nbsp;</p> <p>Powerful and unforgettable, <i>In Pieces</i> is an inspiring and important account of life as a woman in the second half of the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>";
