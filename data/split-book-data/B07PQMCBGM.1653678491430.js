window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The 10th book in the best-selling Chronicles of St Mary's series, which follows a group of tea-soaked disaster magnets as they hurtle their way around History. If you love Jasper Fforde or Ben Aaronovitch, you won't be able to resist Jodi Taylor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>You can't change History. History doesn't like it. There are always consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Max is no stranger to taking matters into her own hands. Especially when she's had A Brilliant Idea. Yes, it will mean breaking a few rules, but - as Max always says - they're not her rules. Seconded to the Time Police to join in the hunt for the renegade Clive Ronan, Max is a long way from St Mary's. But life in the future does have its plus points - although not for long.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>A problem with the Time Map reveals chaos in the 16th century and the wrong Tudor queen on the throne. History has gone rogue, there's a St Mary's team right in the firing line and Max must step up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>You know what they say. Hope for the best. But plan for the worst.</p>";
