window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A movie deal for the devil's autobiography slash romance? Priceless. </p> <p>Maybe I should choose George Clooney to play me in the movie.... No. Too gray. </p> <p>As much as I can't see anyone playing me but me, I have far more important issues on my agenda - like finding the woman who stole my soul. Well, not exactly stole.... I might have made the switch and taken hers, but the siren Elle Rinoa has my soul nonetheless. </p> <p>Maybe Brad Pitt would be a good Lucifer.... No. Too blond. </p> <p>Fate and I are on a crash course with destiny, looking for the one woman who can change both of our lives - mine for the better, Fate's for the worse. Never in my wildest imaginings did I think the devil could have a happily ever after, but now I have hope. </p> <p>Maybe Jamie Dornan would do me justice.... No. Fifty shades of wrong. </p> <p>Armed with a tremendously bad attitude and with my two grumpy nieces in tow, I will find my woman and make her stay - even if I have to cuff her to me for the rest of eternity. Elle Rinoa is mine, and as soon as she sees everything my way we will be fine. </p> <p>Maybe Dwayne Johnson would be an excellent Satan.... No. Too bald. </p> <p>Whatever. With my insane mother proposing a disturbingly psychotic plan to find my girl and my father breaking every appliance in heaven and hell, I feel I have no choice but to go with my mother's half-baked scheme. I've done crazy, but this one will take the cake or put me six feet under - for real. </p> <p>How about Joe Manganiello playing me? No. I'm prettier. </p> <p>My siren doesn't know what's about to hit her. I play for keeps, and I play to win. Of course I cheat, but that's neither here nor there. It's showtime, folks. </p>";
