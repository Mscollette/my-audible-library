Now installed as the duchess of Kesgrave in elegant splendor in Berkeley Square, she is confounded by the stately residence’s seemingly endless array of rooms.</p> <p>And every time one of the maids addresses her as \"your grace\", she flinches. And the butler! Oh, yes, that imposing servant holds her in utter contempt and has no qualms about sharing his opinion with the rest of the staff.</p> <p>It’s all so wretched.&nbsp;</p> <p>But just as Bea begins to despair - a bright spot.</p> <p>A neighboring house has suffered a ghastly tragedy, and although the constable deems it an inadvertent decapitation, she can’t believe anyone could be so careless as to accidentally lose his head.</p> <p>Determined to discover the truth, the new duchess pays her first social call. Because even if she can’t find her way around her palatial home, she certainly knows her way around a murder.&nbsp;</p>";
