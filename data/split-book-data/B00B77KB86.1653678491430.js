window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Amy and Effy Tribble, two charming but impoverished spinster sisters, lose out on a much needed inheritance, they place an advertisement in <i>The Morning Post</i> and hire themselves out as professional chaperones. Vowing to prepare even the most difficult misses for marriage, the Tribble sisters will spend a London season on each client in this delightful Regency series, The School for Manners. Felicity Baronsheath, their first assignment, turns out to be more of a challenge than they could have ever imagined. Not only is Felicity indifferent to the idea of marriage, but she has been permitted to roam free on her father's estates, hunting and carousing like any young lord. </p> <p>When her neighbor, the Marquess of Ravenswood, agrees to help the Tribbles set up their London town house, he confirms their observation that Felicity is a spoilt brat. And when Felicity insists on remaining unrefined, the Tribbles begin to fear that her season--and their new business venture - will end in disaster.</p>";
