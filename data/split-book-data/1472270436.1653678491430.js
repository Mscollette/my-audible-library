window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A Chronicles of St Mary's short story that is sure to entertain. If you love Jasper Fforde or Ben Aaronovitch, you won't be able to resist Jodi Taylor.</b></p> <p>Includes bonus St Mary's escapades 'Desiccated Water' and 'Markham and the Anal Probing' - never before heard in audio - and original introductions read by the author herself.</p> <p><i>'Max, your father is here. He's come to take Matthew away.'</i></p> <p>Have you ever wondered what would happen if Max's husband met Max's father? What would Leon do?</p> <p>They're normally a fairly amiable bunch, but this is the story of what to expect if St Mary's doesn't like someone. As in, really doesn't like someone. Warning: contains a unit-wide criminal enterprise, a great deal of illegal activity and a sad misuse of public resources. All the things a father will do to protect his family.</p> <p>It is also a story of revenge. Because this is payback - St Mary's style.</p> <p><b>Bonus stories</b></p> <p>'Desiccated Water' - Professor Rapson breaks astonishing new ground with his latest feat of scientific invention.</p> <p>'Markham and the Anal Probing' - when Markham disappears in the middle of nowhere, Max jumps to the only logical conclusion: alien abduction.</p>";
