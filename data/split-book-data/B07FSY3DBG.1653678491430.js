window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This exclusive Audible edition includes five downloadable prints featuring beautifully designed quotes from the book and access to Rachel's inspirational keynote from the wildly popular Rise Conference.</b></p> <p>I believe we can change the world. But first, we’ve got to stop living in fear of being judged for who we are.</p> <p>Rachel Hollis has seen it too often: women allowing their lives to pass them by. They feel a tugging on their hearts for something more, but they’re afraid of embarrassment, of falling short of perfection, of stepping too far outside the norm. Hollis’s energy and passion are undeniable as she powerfully narrates her own words, encouraging women to live up to their full potential and chase their most audacious dreams.</p> <p>In <i>Girl, Stop Apologizing</i>, #1 <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and founder of a multimillion-dollar media company, Rachel Hollis sounds a wake-up call and lets listeners in on her personal roadmap for success. She knows many women have been taught to define themselves through other people—whether as wife, mother, daughter, or employee—instead of learning how to own who they are and what they want. Challenging women everywhere to stop talking themselves out of their dreams, Hollis identifies the excuses to discard, the behaviors to adopt, and the skills to acquire on the path to believing in yourself.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library on your web browser, along with the audio.</b><br> &nbsp;</p>";
