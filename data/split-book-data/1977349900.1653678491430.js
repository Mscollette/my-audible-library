window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>My Grandmother, Agnes Bartlett, used to own Cardinal Woolsey's knitting shop then died and left her shop to me, without informing me that she wasn't actually dead. She's a vampire and part of the world's strangest craft circle-the Vampire Knitting Club.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As you might imagine, this means she's free to interfere in how I run the business that used to be hers. She's trying to teach me to knit, and it's not going well. She's also trying to teach me how to be a witch, since it turns out I'm from a long line of witches. Another tiny detail about my family that no one ever told me, along with the long-lost witch cousins I recently discovered. But I'm learning. I've got my family spell book, my black cat familiar, some powers that sometimes scare me, and an interesting new group of friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>My archaeologist parents are coming to visit and bringing me a gift I could do without. So, to recap, I run a knitting shop, and I can't knit. I'm a beginning witch who can't always control her cat, never mind her magic, and my love life is as tangled as the last sock I tried to knit. Oh, and for some reason, I keep getting involved in murder investigations. Good thing I have my vampire knitters to help sniff out clues. At least I've finally hired the perfect assistant, a real demon with the crochet hook. Or is she too perfect?</p>";
