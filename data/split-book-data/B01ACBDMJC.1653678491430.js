window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Where does a Demon go when she gets deported from Hell? Kentucky. Eden, Kentucky, to be more specific - where nothing is exactly as it seems. </p> <p>My name is Dixie. I'm a Demon - a lousy Demon. I'm a 21-year-old virgin, and I have a battery-operated boyfriend. My magic is iffy at best and downright dangerous at worst. Leaving Hell to represent my race is not high on my list of things to do. Hell was exact. Hell was simple. All I want to do is get to home base with the hotter-than-Hades Demon of my dreams and work on my dark side so Satan, my dad, will get off my ass. Instead I end up in Kentucky looking for the Balance of Chaos, avoiding pole dancing classes with Mother Nature, and finding out my invisible friend is a silver-skinned destructive weather pattern. And if that isn't craptastic enough, the damn Sword of Death is missing again, and whoever has it wants the King of the Underworld dead. Seriously. </p> <p>With new powers emerging daily, keeping my Demon side, horniness, and general disgust under wraps doesn't make it any easier to fit in with the humans. Thankfully my priorities are in line: get laid...save world...try not to blow up kitchen appliances...and get laid again. I am ready to rumble. All I want to do is go back to Hell, but with the balance of good and evil in my hands, I'm stuck in the Garden of Eden. Oh well, what the Hell. Someone has to save the world before there's no world left to save. Might as well be me. </p>";
