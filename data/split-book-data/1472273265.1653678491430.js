Luke can't wait to bear arms. Jane has a date. And Matthew still hasn't had his hair cut.</p> <p>But Time waits for no one, and neither do criminal masterminds. A major threat to the Timeline is looming, one far deadlier than mere idiots who want to change history. And when a familiar face becomes a Very Important Lead, will conflicting family loyalties spell trouble for Team Weird?</p> <p>One missing. One guilt-ridden. And one facing the end of their Time Police career before it's even begun. Not so good then, after all.</p>";
