window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They say you shouldn't push your luck. Max gives her own luck a massive shove every day - and it's only a matter of time until luck pushes back.... </p> <p>January, 1536 - the day of Henry VIII's infamous jousting accident. Historians from St Mary's are there in force, recording and documenting. And arguing - obviously. A chance meeting between Max and the Time Police leads to a plan of action. And it's one that will have very serious consequences - especially for Max. </p> <p>Her private life is already more than a little rocky. But with Leon recovering and Matthew safe in the future, there will never be a better opportunity to bring down Clive Ronan once and for all. From Tudor England to the burning city of Persepolis - and from a medieval siege to a very nasty case of 19th-century incarceration - Max is determined that this time he will not escape. </p> <p><b>Please note: this audio was updated on 11th April 2018 to add the final chapter.</b> </p>";
