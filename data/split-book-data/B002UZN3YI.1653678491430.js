window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>National best seller</b></p> <p><b>“A startling vision of what the cycles of history predict for the future.” (</b><b><i>USA Weekend</i></b><b>)</b><br> <br> William Strauss and Neil Howe will change the way you see the world - and your place in it.&nbsp;With blazing originality,&nbsp;<i>The Fourth Turning</i>&nbsp;illuminates the past, explains the present, and reimagines the future. Most remarkably, it offers an utterly persuasive prophecy about how&nbsp;America’s past will predict its future.&nbsp;</p> <p>Strauss and Howe base this vision on a provocative theory of American history. The authors look back 500 years and uncover a distinct pattern: Modern history moves in cycles, each one lasting about the length of a long human life, each composed of four eras - or \"turnings\" - that last about 20 years and that always arrive in the same order.&nbsp;In <i>The Fourth Turning</i>, the authors illustrate these cycles using a&nbsp;brilliant analysis of the post-World War II period.</p> <p>First comes a High, a period of confident expansion as a new order takes root after the old has been swept away. Next comes an Awakening, a time of spiritual exploration and rebellion against the now-established order. Then comes an Unraveling, an increasingly troubled era in which individualism triumphs over crumbling institutions. Last comes a Crisis - the Fourth Turning - when society passes through a great and perilous gate in history. Together, the four turnings comprise history's seasonal rhythm of growth, maturation, entropy, and rebirth.</p> <p><i>The Fourth Turning&nbsp;</i>offers bold predictions about how all of us can prepare, individually and collectively, for America’s next rendezvous with destiny.</p>";
