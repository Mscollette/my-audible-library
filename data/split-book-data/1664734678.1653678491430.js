window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Whoever said life begins at 40 must have been heavily medicated, drunk, or delusional.</b></p> <p>Thirty-nine was a fantastic year. I was married to the man I loved. I had a body that worked without creaking. My grandma, who raised me, was still healthy, and life was pretty damned good.</p> <p>But as they say, all good things come to an end. I’d honestly love to know who “they” are and rip them a new one.</p> <p>One year later, I’m a widow. My joints are starting to ache. Gram is in the nursing home, and dead people think my home is some kind of supernatural bed-and-breakfast. Gluing body parts onto semi-transparent people has become a side job - deceased people I’m not even sure are actually there. I think they need my help, but since I don’t speak dead, we’re having a few issues.</p> <p>To add to the heap of trouble, there’s a new dangerously smokin’ hot lawyer at the firm who won’t stop giving me the eye. My BFF is thrilled with her new frozen face, thanks to her plastic surgeon, her alimony check, and the miracle of Botox. And then there’s the little conundrum that I’m becoming way too attached to my ghostly squatters.... Like Cher, I’d like to turn back time. Now.</p> <p>No can do.</p> <p>Whatever. I have wine, good friends, and an industrial sized box of superglue. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Everything, apparently.</p> <p>All in all, it’s shaping up to be a wonderful midlife crisis....</p>";
